\title{To B1 Proficiency in Italian in 100 Days}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
You will need for this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An Italian Catholic Bible\footnote{\url{http://www.vatican.va/archive/ITA0001/_INDEX.HTM}}
	\item A Complete Italian Grammar, or the Capacity to Google the Tables and read them
	\item A Frequency List or Frequency Dictionary of Italian Words\footnote{\url{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Italian50k}}
	\item Lots of Notebooks (Ideally 80 Page School Exercise books, as they're cheap and you can get a 10 pack cheaply)
	\item Know how to use the Method of Loci quickly (This will be how you'll retain the information)
\end{itemize}

This exercise of growing in Italian Fluency (which is somewhat experimental and subject to change) is to give an exhaustive knowledge of Italian Grammar, some experience of reading and listening, and a knowledge of basic Italian Vocabulary. This is intended for an ecclesiastical audience, and assumes motivation and a knowledge of what grammatical terms like mode and gender refer to. \\


To learn with the method of loci, each form should be memorised as an individual object for grammar, and the word in itself when you get to the Frequency Dictionary. Also, feel free to take short breaks if you get burnt out.\\

If speaking fluency is also desired, then add the FSI Course in Italian to this (However, this is not recommended because this will be estimated at 2 hours a day, and FSI will add at least another hour). Expect this to be a slog and treat it as a penance.
